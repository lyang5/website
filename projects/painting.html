        <h4>This project was made in response to the following brief: "produce storylines ... and fully functional alpha prototypes of select elements for a "mystery manor" experience..." Created, designed, and fabricated in a team of 6, our solution was a mysterious goblet puzzle. The setting takes place in a dining room setting with goblets on the table and paintings on the wall. However, the normal looking paintings have hidden areas where the bottom of goblets were the "key" to the "lock" of the painting. This was the product of 2.744, Product Design, "a project-centered graduate course focused on the design of products that are well-matched to user needs, with an emphasis on user experience, product form, human factors, and marketplace realities." </h4>

Again, the goblets would be the key to the final piece of the puzzle, returning the goblets back to the table would in effect, reset the puzzle for the next group.</h4><br><br>
